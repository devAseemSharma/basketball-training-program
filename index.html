<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction &amp; Key Principles</h2>
    <p>After a long layoff, building athletic conditioning and basketball skills requires a phased approach. This program combines strength training, agility work, basketball‑specific practice, and nutrition guidance to restore performance. Start conservatively; allow your body to adapt and increase intensity gradually. Maintain consistency with 5–6 training days per week and integrate at least one rest day for recovery. A thorough warm‑up before every session reduces injury risk by increasing blood flow, flexibility and muscle activation. Focus on progressive overload in strength exercises and interval‑based conditioning to mimic game demands while protecting joints from overuse.</p>
</section>
<section id="warmup">
    <h2>Warm‑Up &amp; Mobility Routine</h2>
    <p>A proper warm‑up primes your muscles, joints and nervous system. Spend 10–15 minutes at the start of each workout to loosen up and activate stabilisers.</p>
    <h3>General Warm‑Up</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Light cardio (jogging, skipping or cycling) for 5&nbsp;minutes to raise core temperature and heart rate.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dynamic Mobility Drills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leg swings (front/back &amp; side‑to‑side), walking lunges with torso twist, high knees, butt kicks and arm circles to mobilise hips, hamstrings, quads and shoulders.</li>
        <li>Lateral lunges and ankle rocks to improve hip and ankle mobility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Activation Exercises</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Glute bridges, monster walks or lateral band walks to activate the gluteus medius.</li>
        <li>Planks or bird‑dogs for core activation.</li>
        <li>Ankle resistance band series (inversion, eversion, dorsiflexion &amp; plantarflexion) and calf raises to strengthen ankle stabilisers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Neuromuscular Prep</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Short accelerations or defensive slides across the court to ready your nervous system for explosive movements.</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section id="strength">
    <h2>Strength Training</h2>
    <p>Strength workouts rebuild muscle, enhance joint stability and increase power. Perform 2–3 sessions per week, focusing on compound movements with controlled progression.</p>
    <h3>Major Exercises</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Squats &amp; Lunges:</strong> 3×8–12 squats (bodyweight or loaded) and 2–3×8 lunges each leg. Use a resistance band around the knees to reinforce proper alignment and strengthen the quadriceps.</li>
        <li><strong>Deadlifts / Hip Hinges:</strong> 3×8–10 Romanian deadlifts for posterior chain strength and knee protection.</li>
        <li><strong>Calf Raises:</strong> 3×15–20 on a step, emphasising slow eccentric lowering for Achilles tendon resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper Body Push/Pull:</strong> Push‑ups or bench press (3×8–12), overhead presses (3×8–10), rows or pull‑ups (3×10) to build balanced upper body strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Core &amp; Stability:</strong> Planks, side planks, Russian twists, leg raises and Pallof presses to develop core stability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Knee &amp; Ankle Prehab</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terminal Knee Extension Squats:</strong> Anchor a band behind the knee; perform partial single‑leg squats reaching forward, sideways and backward. This exercise targets the vastus medialis and improves patellar stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance Drills:</strong> Single‑leg stands (eyes open/closed) and mini‑squats on unstable surfaces to enhance proprioception and ankle stability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Increase weights or repetitions gradually each week as long as you maintain good form and recovery. Rest 1–2 minutes between sets for compound lifts and 1 minute for smaller movements.</p>
</section>
<section id="conditioning">
    <h2>Conditioning &amp; Agility</h2>
    <p>Basketball demands repeated bursts of high‑intensity effort. Perform 2–3 conditioning sessions weekly, using intervals and agility drills to develop aerobic base, speed and quickness.</p>
    <h3>Low‑Impact Cardio</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with 15–20 minutes on a bike, elliptical or in the pool if joints are sore; it builds endurance without heavy impact.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Interval Sprints &amp; Drills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shuttle runs (“suicides”) on the half court: sprint to key lines and back in progression; rest 1–2 minutes between sets.</li>
        <li>Sideline crossings (modified “17s”): continuous sideline‑to‑sideline sprints; build up reps over weeks.</li>
        <li>Defensive slides: 20‑second lateral shuffles with 40‑second rest to train lateral quickness and leg endurance.</li>
        <li>Agility ladder patterns and cone drills to improve foot speed and coordination.</li>
        <li>Jump rope: 5 sets of 1 minute with 30&nbsp;seconds rest; emphasise quick, light bounces.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Gradual Plyometrics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pogo hops, low box jumps and lateral bounds build explosive power. Limit volume and prioritise quality to protect joints.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Progressively increase sprint count or reduce rest as conditioning improves. If joints ache, swap intense sprints for a steady bike or swim session.</p>
</section>
<section id="skills">
    <h2>Basketball Skills Practice</h2>
    <p>Daily skill work restores muscle memory and game feel. Combine stationary and dynamic drills to sharpen shooting, dribbling and footwork.</p>
    <h3>Shooting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Begin with close‑range form shooting (20 makes) focusing on mechanics. Move to mid‑range spots (5 spots × 10 makes each), then add three‑pointers as strength improves.</li>
        <li>Shoot at least 20 free throws every practice, interspersed throughout workouts to simulate game fatigue.</li>
        <li>Layups: Practice both left‑ and right‑hand layups (10 each). Progress to continuous layups with full‑court dribble when conditioning allows.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dribbling &amp; Ball‑Handling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stationary drills: 50 crossovers, 50 between‑the‑legs and 50 behind‑the‑back dribbles; include figure‑8 patterns. Keep eyes up and dribble low.</li>
        <li>Movement drills: Perform dribble moves on the move (crossover, hesitation, between‑legs) and finish with a pull‑up jumper.</li>
        <li>Emphasise your weaker hand with single‑hand dribble drills and off‑hand layups.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Footwork &amp; Agility with Ball</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Practice triple‑threat stance, jab steps and pivoting on each foot to strengthen knee and ankle control.</li>
        <li>If relevant, work on post moves such as drop‑step and hook shots.</li>
        <li>Combine ball handling with defensive slides to simulate game situations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Integrate skills into conditioning by taking shots or doing dribble moves between sprints. Play pick‑up games or scrimmages when your base fitness improves to translate drills into game context.</p>

    <h2>Nutrition Guidelines (Vegetarian)</h2>
    <p>Proper fueling supports training, muscle growth and recovery. Aim for a balanced diet rich in quality proteins, carbohydrates and healthy fats, adjusted to your energy needs.</p>
    <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Consume 1.2–2.0&nbsp;g/kg body weight per day, distributed evenly across meals. Include sources like milk, yogurt, paneer, tofu, lentils, beans, chickpeas, nuts and seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> For moderate training load aim for 5–7&nbsp;g/kg/day to replenish glycogen. Choose whole grains, rice, oats, fruits and starchy vegetables; use easily digestible carbs (e.g. banana) before workouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Fats:</strong> 20–30% of calories from healthy fats such as nuts, seeds, avocados and olive oil; avoid heavy fatty meals immediately before training.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nutrient Timing &amp; Hydration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a balanced pre‑workout snack (fruit and nuts or yogurt) and a post‑workout meal containing ~0.25&nbsp;g/kg of fast‑absorbing protein (e.g. whey) plus carbohydrates to stimulate recovery.</li>
        <li>Eat 4–6 small meals per day to meet calorie and protein needs without feeling overly full.</li>
        <li>Drink at least 2.5–3&nbsp;L of fluids daily; increase on hard training days and include electrolytes to replace sweat losses.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Micronutrients &amp; Supplements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure adequate iron by consuming legumes, leafy greens and fortified cereals; pair with vitamin&nbsp;C rich foods to enhance absorption.</li>
        <li>Maintain calcium and vitamin&nbsp;D intake via dairy or fortified plant milk; consider a vitamin&nbsp;D supplement if sun exposure is limited.</li>
        <li>Vitamin&nbsp;B12 is found in dairy but may require supplementation for vegetarians.</li>
        <li>Optional: creatine monohydrate (5&nbsp;g/day) can aid high‑intensity performance, especially for vegetarians.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="injury">
    <h2>Injury Prevention &amp; Recovery</h2>
    <p>Given your history of ankle sprains and knee pain, prioritise joint care. Consistently do the prehab exercises described, wear supportive shoes and consider bracing or taping during high‑intensity games. After workouts, cool down with stretching and foam rolling to maintain flexibility and reduce tension.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ankle care:</strong> Perform band exercises (inversion/eversion, etc.), calf raises and balance drills. Ice ankles if tender and wear supportive footwear on the concrete court.</li>
        <li><strong>Knee care:</strong> Reinforce quadriceps and glutes with TKE squats and hip abductor work. Practise soft landings and avoid excessive jumping volume, especially on hard surfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest &amp; Recovery:</strong> Listen to your body – take a rest day when pain or fatigue is high. Use ice, compression, elevation and gentle activity (e.g. cycling) to manage soreness. Aim for at least 8&nbsp;hours of sleep to maximise recovery.</li>
    </ul>
